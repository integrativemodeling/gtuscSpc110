# Integrative model of the γTuSC-Spc110 complex 

This repository pertains to the integrative model of the  γTuSC-Spc110 complex based on data from cryo-EM, chemical crosslinking, and X-ray crystallography. 

The repository contains input data, scripts for modeling and results including bead models and localization probability density maps. It uses 
[IMP](https://integrativemodeling.org) (*Integrative Modeling Platform*).

## Folder structure:
1) [inputs](inputs/) : contains all the input data used for modeling such as PDB files and crosslink files.
2) [scripts](scripts/) : scripts to prep input files, perform sampling, and analysis are provided. 
3) [results](results/) : contains the models and localization densities of the top cluster.
